    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very trendy topic in the data science area today that is really handy for tasks like **chat bots**, movie or **product review analysis** and especially **tweet classification**. In this notebook, we will cover the **classification aspect of NLP** and go over the features that Spark has for cleaning and preparing your data for analysis. We will also touch on how to implement **ML Pipelines** to a few of our data processing steps to help make our code run a bit faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in the NLP concept review lectures, the text you process must first be cleaned, tokenized and vectorized. Essentially, we need to covert our text into a vector of numbers. But how do we do that? Spark has a variety of built in functions to accomplish all of these tasks very easily. We will cover all of it here!\n",
